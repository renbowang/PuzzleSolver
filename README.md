"# PuzzleSolver" 
This program solves a unique Russian puzzle problem. Given a puzzle board (the target shape) and a set of puzzle pieces, it determines if the pieces can perfectly fill the board without overlap or gapsâ€”using all pieces exactly once. Each piece can be rotated but cannot be flipped.

If a solution exists, the program outputs one valid arrangement of the pieces fitting the puzzle.
